Student Involvement Fair Optimization

Final Project: Student Involvement Fair Optimization. 
As Ohio State students, the Student Involvement Fair is a large-scale event that attracts a large crowd. A reason why this event is well attended is because of added incentives the Student Organization booths give (ex. Food, T-shirts, etc.). From personal experience, it is very difficult to visit many booths due to the amount of human traffic. Our group intends to optimize a student’s plan to visit 25 specific booths within the duration of the event, which is 3 hours.  

In the uploaded files, there are several Excel spreadsheets, containing the data used for the optimization. ISE Project Distances Hour 1-2 contain the distances between each booth, measured in feet. ISE Project Wait Time Hour 1-3 contain the wait times at each booth, varying at the hour of the event. 

ISE Final Project Wait times.py contains the code that was used to minimize the total time spent waiting at each booth in the three hours of the event.

ISE TSP Hour 1-3.py contains the code that was used to solve the TSP (traveling salesman problem) to determine which booths were visited during a certain hour of the event (ex. 1,2 or 3). This optimized the minimum total distance traveled between the booths for each of the three hours.
